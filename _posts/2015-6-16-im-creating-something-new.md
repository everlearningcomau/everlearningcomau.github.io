![change design]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog-images/change-design.jpg)


I'm creating something new. I'm doing it in public so I can get reactions, feedback and co-design it.

I decided to draw my ideas and progress in a notebook with a pen sporadically coloured in with crayons. So expect lots of photos.

My goal is to design a product that teaches the tools and process of what I call **change design**.

What exactly is change design? Stay tuned.

I'd love to get you feedback, talk more or answer question about this. [Tweet](http://twitter.com/blairrorani) or [email](mailto:blair@rorani.com) me.
