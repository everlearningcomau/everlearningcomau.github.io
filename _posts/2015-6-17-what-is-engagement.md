Engagement is a super important business word and at the same time it can be a pretty fluffy term.

What businesses normally call engagement is usually a combination of alignment and action.

## Alignment
People need to agree on a shared view of the world and how the future will be different and better. Priorities, goals, rewards, resources etc all need to be aligned.

Change designers use stories, visual communication and design thinking to create alignment.

## Action
A shared world view about a particular thing is great but if it never leaves everyone's heads and hearts nothing changes. People need to ability to act on what they now think and feel.

Change designers use practical, visual, game-like tools to make taking action (practising and doing) easy and make progress visible.
