Business teams who want to create change can get value from to using visual, story, game and digital design and design thinking.

I'm creating visual, tactile tools and a process to make that easy. The outcome will be a shared vocabulary and frameworks for understanding and applying **change design** to business challenges.

These could be a new vision or strategy, a technology or process change, a change in the minds of an audience, in the purchasing decisions of a customer or the skill level of employees or partners.

Achieving any business goal requires change. Change design can help you get clarity on the desired outcome, achieve alignment with stakeholders and enable action.
